            <h1>This is my blog page that has all of the important information about me as a IT Professional.</h1>
            <h2>SKC Feedback</h2>
            <p>Your motivation is nice but still a bit too general, It is nice to hear that you are curious about ICT
                and that you are starting to have a passion for solving problems and seeing the logic behind technology.
                However, I recommend asking yourself why are you interested in IT? What makes you interested in this
                study program in particular? I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career and
                to search for the true motivation that will keep you going throughout the study program. This will be
                very helpful in difficult situations or challenges that you may encounter during your education.

                When looking at your goals after completing the studies, its nice to see you are interested in also
                teaching ICT in the future, ask yourself why specifically that? And when it comes to companies like
                Google or Microsoft, why are you interested in companies that work with others? What makes you want to
                work in a team? I would recommend you try and research more, maybe search the career opportunities that
                interest you in ICT, what would you like to do in your day to day? How would you like your role to look
                like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught. I also recommend you
                participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information
                about different professions in the ICT field.

                Looking at your personal analysis, it is clear you are aware and thought about your strengths and
                weaknesses, this is very good and beneficial to understand yourself and to become a better professional
                in the future. When it comes to your threat, I recommend looking at tools and what can help you prepare
                for situations where youll be working with other people and they will not always listen or cooperate, or
                will make mistakes, how youll deal with such situations in a professional manner? How will you control
                your frustration with others that work or think differently than you? I understand that it may be
                difficult and not always will be smooth or fun working with others in groups or in class, but I can
                assure you, youll learn a lot from your classmates, it will help you develop and enrich your knowledge
                and views, so try and come with an open mind to them as much as possible.</p>
            <h2>Thoughts about it</h2>
            <p>Made me think more why and what I really want to do in this field.</p>
            <p>Also helped to know what I need to research and questions that I need to answer by myself.</p>
